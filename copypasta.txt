INNERSLOTH
Innersloth(Inner😳😳sus) is a 😳 sus American 󰎇 🏈 video 📽 🎮📽 game 🎴👾🎲 👾 development studio 🎙 🎙 initially founded in 1841 as a broom 🧹 🧹 manufacturing company. They 💁💁💁 💁💁💁 found success 📈 📈 in their brooms, 🧹 🧹 which were made from 😤 😤 sloth 🦥 🦥 innards, that reportedly sold in the 🤘 🤘 millions. In 1975 they 💁 󰔯 would find 🔎 🔎 themselves in a 🥺🥺scandal with premature deaths ☠️ ⚰️ sprouting from 😤🥺😤 their brooms 🧹 🧹 being ingested by babies, 🥺👶🚼🍼🫃 🫃 costing them billions and sending them to bankruptcy. In 1987, as a last 🌗⏮️ 🌜 ditch effort to save 🔖 💾 themselves they 💁💁💁 💁 released the 🤘 🤘 popular sex and dating 🗓 👫 game 🀄 🎴 titled Among Us: Mating 🧉 🧉 & Dating 󰔟 💏 for 🔰 🔰 the 🫵 🫵 GameBox. This game 🎱🎮 👾 failed 🏳 💩 to capture audiences, bringing in -72 562 sales 📈 💵 and ultimately killing the 🤘 🤘 studio. 🎙 🎙 Among Us: Mating 🧉 🧉 & Dating 🗓 󰔦 would then be forgotten for 🈺 🔰 years until the 🤣 🤘 great 󰏅 󰏅 year of 2001 when ඞAmong Us would be released on the 🤣 🫵 Nokia phone. 📱 📶 It was a smash hit 👊 👊 with audiences everywhere spawning merchandise, fanart, pornography, cartoons, movies 🎥 🎥 and much more. ➕ ➕ Innersloth rebranded themselves in 2002 but 😥 😥 due to a typo they 💁 󰔯 spelled it as ඞAmogus International🥺. 🌎🌎🌎 🌍

AMONG US (2001)
The 🤣 🤘🫵 hit 👊 👊 social deduction game 🎮 👾🎱 Among Us (2001) was available for 🔰 🔰 the 🫵🤣 🫵🤘🫵🤘🫵🤘 price of $10.99 on Nokia phones. 📳 📴 The 🤣 🤘 game 🃏 🀄 featured small, ◾ 🤏🤌 armless colored astronauts 󰥗 󰥡 called 🤙 🤙 📮 mogii (⛔ mogus = single) who worked 🏢 💼 together 🤲 🤲 to complete tasks on the 🫵 🤘 Skeld. Among them however was a shapeshifting parasite simply called 🤙 🤙🤙🤙 the 🤘 🤘 Impostor. Impostors would try to blend in and act 🎭 🎭 as a 📮 mogii or crewmate, which leads them to acting 🎭 🎭 😳suspicious(😳sus😳). The 🫵 🤣🤘 game 🎴 🀄 could be played 🎮 🎮🕹 between 4 🕟🕓 🍀 and 10 players online or hosting/joining games 🎯 🎮 with friends. 🐕 🐕 The 🫵 🤘 goal 🥅 🥅 of Among Us (2001) is to find 🔎 🔍 out(😳sus😳 out) the 🤘 🤘🫵 impostor and eject ⏏️ ⏏️ them. Among Us (2001), being a social deduction game 🀄 🎲🎯 however, would lead people 🫂 󰰁 to not 🈶 ⏳ trust each other due to them possibly being an impostor, which commonly resulted in real conflicts between people. 󰔪 󰔲 The 🫵 🤣 popularity of Among Us (2001) caused most of these cases to be completely overshadowed, only surfacing in recent years. Among Us (2001) was and still 󰰢 🧍 is a worldwide sensation and should be respected 🫡 🫡 by generations to come.

WHAT 😦😦 ARE IMPOSTORS?
Impostors are 👉 👉 a shapeshifting parasite whose goal 🥅 🥅 is to kill 🚬 🚬 and beat 💓 💓 all of the 🫵 🤣🫵📮 mogii on the 🫵🤣 🤣 Skeld (very 😳 sussy bussy). There are 👉 👉 a variety of ways 🌌 🌌 they 💁 💁 can do this: • Killing them with the 🤣 🤘 kill 🚬 🚬🚬🚬 button 🆔🆔🆔 🅾㊙️ • Misleading the 🫵🤣 🤘 other 📮 mogii to eject ⏏️ ⏏️ their friends 🐕 🐕 • Breeding the 🤣🫵 🤘 📮 mogii • Sabotaging the 🤣 🤣 ship 🛳 ⚓ Killing makes use of the 🫵 🤣 kill 🚬 🚬 button 🆚 ⏯️ which swiftly removes ❌ ❌ mogii and is the 🤘 🤘 most reliable tool 🪓 🔨 to an impostor. Killing a ⛔⛔ mogus leaves 🍂 🍂 behind ⛅🌥 🌦 their corpse which can be reported by other mogii, leading to a discussion on who did the 🤣 🤣 crime. 󰡷 󰡷󰡷󰡷 If you're not ⏳⏳⏳ ⏳ careful, standing 🧍 🧍 infront of a dead 🥺⚰️🪫 🪫🧟 ⛔⛔ mogus while others are 👉 👉 nearby can create 🔨 🔨 the 🤣 🤘 illusion that you 🫵 😊 killed them, even 🌝 🌚🌆 if you 😀 😀 didn't. One 🕜🩱 🔞 can prove that they 󰔯󰔯󰔯 󰔯 are 👉 👉 innocent by performing 🎭 🎭 a visual task (see p. 10) or by bribing the 🫵 🤘 other 📮 mogii, either with a blowjob or with money. 📉 💴 After being reported the 🫵 🫵🤘 body is eaten and the 🤘 🤘 game 🎮 🕹🕹🕹 resumes. One 🕜 🕐 of the 🫵🤘 🤣 coolest features about impostors is that they 󰔯 💁 can easily mislead 📮 mogii and put them on the 🤘 🫵 wrong path to finding 🔍 🔍 out 😵 😵 the 🫵 🤘 impostor. This tactic can be done ⌛ ⏳ in two 🕝 🕑 forms: acting 🎭 🎭 as another ⛔⛔ mogus or by blaming a ⛔ mogus. Acting 🎭 🎭 as another ⛔ mogus simply means 😏 😏 blending in and pretending 🥲 🥲 you 🤟 😀😊 are 👉 👉 their friend. 🐕 🐕 This is easily performable by saying 🗣 🗣 "Where? Any sus 😳?" at meetings and just staying out 😵 😵 of trouble like 💙 💞 an innocent and shy 😳 😊 ⛔⛔ mogus. Blaming other 📮 mogii is done ⏳ ⏳ by saying 🗣 🗣 the 🤣 🫵🤣 classic "x did it, x is sus😳, i 😊 😊 saw 🪚 🪚 x vent, x faked tasks" (x is usually Red). 📮 Mogii are 👉 👉 easily fooled and believe quick answers ✅ ✔️ over 🌄🤭 🫢🫢🫢 factual proof with numerous undeniable sources done ⏳ ⌛ by professionals. Breeding the 🤘 🫵🤘 📮📮 mogii is simple to understand. As an impostor you 😊😀 🤟 come with either a giant cock (or impock) or giant pussy (or impussy). Using these one 🕜 🔞🩱 can breed the 🤣 🤘🫵 📮 mogii and fill them with so 🆘 🆘 much cum (or impcum) that their brain 🧠 🧠 is flooded with cum, destroying it🥺🥺. This is a fancier and hotter 🍧 🍧 way ↕️ ↕️ to kill 🚬 🚬 a ⛔ mo⛔gus but 😥 😥 leaves 🍂 🍂 behind 🌦 🌦 an undesirable mess 🥺 signified by when 📮 mogii get 🉐 🉐 a new 󰖒🌚 🆕 task "Clean 🚰 🚰 up crime 󰡷 󰡷 scene: location". 🗺🗺🗺 🗺🗺🗺 This shows 📺 📺 when and where the 🤣 🤘 crime 󰡷 󰡷 is committed which can be used to 😳sus😳 out 😵 😵 the 🤘🫵 🤣 impostor. THIS IS NOT 🈶 ⏳ PORN😳, IT'S JUST REALITY🥺 Sabotaging the 🫵 🫵 ship ⛴️ 🚀 can be done ⏳ ⏳ in a few ways. ↕️ ↕️ It can be minor 🔞 🔞 inconveniences such as the 🤘🫵 🫵 lights 🚦 🚨 going out 😵 😵 or doors 🗝 🔑 being shut, but 😥 😥 can also be fatal and kill 🚬 🚬 everyone in a single 🔂 🔂 move 🚣🚴🚵🏃🚶 🚶 if nothing 🈚 🈚 is done ⏳ ⌛ about it. It is a pretty good 👍 󰭉 move 🛺 🚶 and is impossible to tell 🗣 🗣 who did the 🤘 🤘 sabotage. Sabotages, like 🥰🥰🥰 👍󰔦 kills 🚬 🚬 and breeding has a cooldown so 🆘 🆘 one 🕜 🕐🩱 should carefully use this move. 🚴 🚴 Sabotages include turning the 🫵 🫵 lights 🚥 🚨 of the 🤘 🤣 ship 🚤🚤🚤 󰣌🚢󰣋 off, 📆 📆 closing doors, 🗝🚪 🚪 failing 🏳 💩 O2, and creating 🛠 🔨 a reactor meltdown (former 2 ✌️ 💕💕💕 harmless, latter ☕ ☕ 2 💕 💕 fatal).

TASKS
In Among Us (2001) exist tasks which are 👉 👉 small 🛩 🛩🤌 minigames (miniminigames) that are 👉 👉 performed 👯 👯 by the 🤣 🤣 📮 mogii. Tasks can be short, 🩳 🩳 common or long 🪘 🪘 depending on RNG, can be a visual task, and 📮 mogii become extremely vulnerable while doing tasks since they 󰔯 💁 can't move. 🚶🚶🚶 🛺 Tasks include: • Align engine 🚒 🚒 output- Long 🪘🪘🪘 🪘 task, Upper engine>Lower engine 🚒 🚒 • Calibrate distributor- Short 🩳 🩳 task, Electrical • Chart 📉💹📊 📈 course- Short 🩳 🩳 task, Navigation 🧭 🧭 • Clean 🚰 🚿 O2 filter- Short 🩳 🩳 task, O2 • Clean 🧼🚰🧽 🛀 vent- Short 🩳 🩳🩳🩳 task, Any vents • Clear asteroids- Long 🪘 🪘 task, Weapons, 🪃🗡🔪⚔️ 🗡 Visual task • Divert power- 🪄 🪄 🪄 Short 🩳 🩳 🩳 task, Electrical > Communications ✉️📫 / Lower 🔈 engine/ Navigation 🧭 / O2 / Security 🔓 / Shields 🛡 / Upper engine 🚒 / Weapons 🔪⚔️ • Empty 🪹 🈳 🈳 chute- Long 🪘 🪘 🪘 task, Cafeteria > Storage, Visual task • Empty 🪹 🈳 🪹 garbage- 🗑 🗑 ♻️🚯 Long 🪘 🪘 🪘 task, Cafeteria > Storage, Visual task • Fix 🔩 🔩 🔧🧰 wiring- Common task, Admin > Navigation 🧭🧭🧭 / Cafeteria > Cafeteria / Security, 🛡 Storage > Admin / Navigation 🧭 / Cafeteria > Cafeteria / Navigation 🧭 / Security, 🔒 Electrical > Storage / Navigation 🧭 / Cafeteria / Admin > Navigation 🧭 / Security ⛔ / Admin / Cafeteria, Navigation 🧭 > Cafeteria > Security 🔏🔒 • Fuel ⛽⛽⛽ ⛽ engines- 🚒 🚒 Long 🪘 🪘 task, Storage>Upper engine>Storage>Lower engine 🚒 🚒 • Inspect sample- Long 🪘 🪘 task, MedBay • Prime 3️⃣7️ 2️⃣shields- 🛡 🔰 Short 🩳 🩳 task, Shields, 🛡 🛡 Visual task • Stabilize steering- Short 🩳 🩳 task, Navigation 🧭 🧭 • Start 🆕 🆕 reactor- Long 🪘 🪘 task, Reactor • Submit scan- Long 🪘 🪘 task, MedBay, Visual task • Swipe card- ♣️ ♣️📇♠️ Common task, Admin • Unlock 🔓 🔓 manifolds- Short 🩳 🩳 task, Reactor • Upload data- 💽 💽 Short 🩳 🩳 task, Cafeteria/Communications/Electrical/Navigation/Weapons>Admin Tasks are 👉 👉 very important to a ⛔ mogus because it is what 😦 😦 helps 🆘 🆘 them win 🏆🏆🏆 🏆 a game, 🃏 🕹 alongside killing the 🫵 🤘 impostors. Once all tasks from 😤 😤 all 📮 mogii are 👉 👉 completed, the 🤣 🫵🤘 📮 mogii win 🏆🏆🏆 🏆🏆🏆 and impostors lose. Impostors in a game 🎯🎯🎯 👾 of Among Us (2001) are 👉 👉 given a list of fake tasks, which are 👉 👉 not 🈶 ⏳ real or do-able, but 😥 😥 are 👉 👉 just here 🈁 🈁📍 to give the 🤘 🫵🤘 impostors something to do while they 💁 💁 act 🎭 🎭 sus. One 🕜 🕜 should keep an eye 😁 👀😄😉🙄 out 😵 😵 for 🈺 🔰 the 🫵 🫵🤣 Tasks Complete bar 🎯 🎯 at the 🫵 🫵 top ⬆️ ⬆️🔝 if stared 💫 ⭐ down ⤵️ 🫳↙️🙃 by a ⛔ mogus, and should move 🚴 🛺 away 💨 💨 from 😤 😤 the 🤣 🤘 task area once the 🤘 🤣 bar 📊 📊 fills, generating the 🫵 🤣🤣🤣 illusion of you 🤟 🫵 completing a task even 🌑🌕🌓 🌕 though you 🤟 😀🤟🫵 didn't and making the 🤘🤣 🫵 ⛔ mogus think 🗯🤔 🗯💭 you 😊 🤟🤟🤟 are 👉 👉 innocent🥺.

VISUAL TASKS
Visual Tasks are 👉 👉 tasks but 😥 😥 instead are 👉👉👉 👉 visible on the 🫵🤣 🤣 map 🗺 🗺 when performed. 👯 👯 This only works 🏢 🏢 if Visual Tasks are 👉 👉 on when a game 🎯 🎴 is being formed, only accessible by the 🤘🫵 🫵🫵🫵 host of said game. 🕹 🀄🎯 Visual tasks are 👉 👉 listed in Tasks(p. 6-9). 🕡🕕 🕡 📮 Mogii should use visual tasks to their advantage by using it to prove they 💁 󰔯 are 👉 👉 friend. 🐶 🐕 As an impostor however, visual tasks must be avoided at all costs because they 💁 󰔯 cannot fake these if visual tasks are 👉 👉 on, making it very obvious to the 🤘 🤘🤣 📮 mogii who are 👉 👉 watching ⌚ 👁 that they 󰔯 💁 are 👉 👉 the 🤣 🤘 impostor and proving they 󰔯 💁 are 👉 👉 foe. This leads to your ejection, but 😥 😥 alternatively, you 😊🤟 😊 can confess 🥺🥺 to the 🤘 🤣 📮 mogii your love 🏩 💖 and passion for 🔰 🈺 them, and to set aside your differences and just have 🈶 🈶 a good 🍖 ✨󰭉 fun 🫧 💃 time 🕖 🕓🕰 with them (this is not ⏳ ⏳ 100% guaranteed and you 🫵 😊 may or may not ⏳ 🈶 be ejected). If visual tasks are 👉 👉 turned off 📴 📆 by the 🤘 🤘🤣 host, all of this information ℹ️ ℹ️ above 🆙 🆙 (minus maybe the 🤘 🫵 confession part) is completely useless (because love 💑 󰔦 conquers all) and should not ⏳ 🈶 be used.

MAPS 📍 📍
Among Us (2001) features many maps 🗾 📍 to play 👾 🕹🎳 on, including the 🤣 🤣 classic and beloved Skeld map, 🗺🗾 🗾 and those other 3. 🕞 🕒 These maps 📍🗾 📍 all vary in layout, appearance, tasks, rooms, 🚺 🧖 size, 🤏 🤏 name, 📛 📛 sex quality and more. ➕ ➕ The 🤘 🤣🤘 Skeld is a large ⬛ 🌥 spaceship flying 🛸 🛸 through space, 🌚📡🌑 🌒🌝 and is the 🫵 🫵🤘 original Among Us (2001) map. 🗺 🗺 This is undoubtedly the 🤣 🤘 best Among Us (2001) map 🗾🗾🗾 🗾 in the 🤣🫵 🤘 game, 🎱 👾 not 🈶 ⏳ just out 😵 😵 of bias, but 😥 😥 has been scientifically proven in recent years to be the 🤣 🤣 best one. 🕜 🕜 Studies 📖 📓 show 📺 🌍 that the 🫵 🤘 color 🎨 🎨 gray 🌔 ❕ (which is like 😘 🧡 90% of the 🤣 🫵 skeld) can force the 🫵🤘 🤘🫵 brain 🧠 🧠 of the 🤘 🤣 player 🕹🎽 🎳👾🎲 to focus on the 🤣 🫵 colored parts 〽️ 〽️ only of the 🫵 🤣 map, 📍🗾 📍 which just so 🆘 🆘 happen to be mostly tasks that the 🤘🤣 🤣🫵 📮 mogii need to do. The 🫵 🫵🤘 other Among Us (2001) maps 🗺📍 🗾🗺 could NEVER have 🈶 🈶 this amount 🈷 🈷 of ඞamogus taskery which only goes to show 🌎 🌏 just the 🫵 🤣 sheer 󰡈 󰡈 brilliance that the 🤣 🤣 Skeld exudes. On top 🎩⏫ 🔝 of this, the 🫵 🤘🤘🤘 task choices for 🔰 🔰 the 🤘 🤣 Skeld are 👉 👉 great, 󰏅 󰏅 and easy to memorize the 🤣 🫵 appearance, location, 🗺 🗺 directions 🗺 👉 and gameplay of, to maximize efficiency out 😵 😵 of the 🤣🫵 🫵 player 🎽 🀄 and allows for 🔰 🔰 Among Us (2001) to be competitive to the 🤣🫵🤣🫵🤣🫵 🤣 point 🔼 🔼 where it can rival other popular competitive games 🎱 🕹 such as ██████ (2005),█████████ (2022) and of course, █████████ (2571). Also notice how literally no 🙈 󰢃👎 one 🕐 🔞🔞🔞 cares 🫂 🫂 about the 🫵 🤘 new 🆕 🌑 maps 🗾 📍🗺 that are 👉 👉 released after the 🤘 🤣 Skeld. It's like 󰔟 😚 "Wow ❕❗ 😮😮😮 guys! 👦👨 󰠣 What's 😦 😦 a Polus?!" then it comes out 😵 😵 and after 2 🕑 🕝🕑 hours of poking it with a stick 🥍 🥍 no 🚯 󰢃 one 🕐 🔞 cares 🫂 🫂 about it and they 󰔯 💁💁💁 just go back 🥹 🔙 to the 🤘 🤣 clearly superior Skeld.

ඞAMOGUS?
ඞAmogus, which can mean 😏 😏 a disease 😷 😷 that causes 🎗 🎗 the 🫵🤘 🤣 affected to see 👁🙈 🙈 everything as a ⛔ mogus, is a word 🔙🔛 🆚 that stems from 😤 😤 the 🤘 🤣 satirical misspelling of the 🤘 🫵 words 🔙 🔛 "Among" and "Us", due to the 🫵 🤣 "n" and " " being left 🤛⬅️◀️🤛⬅️◀️🤛⬅️◀️ ↩️ out 😵 😵 spelling "ඞAmogus". 😳Sussus Amogus was born 🐣 🐣 in Amorgos, the 🤣🫵 🤘 25th island 󰐂 󰎋🏝 of Greece 󰏏 󰏏 in August 1955. This disease 😷 😷 causes 🎗 🎗🎗🎗 the 🤘🫵 🫵 victims to report seeing 🙈 👀 random 🎲 🎲 everyday objects as a ⛔ mogus or form of a ⛔ mogus, such as trash 🚯 🗑 cans, chicken 🐣 🐔 nuggets, lego pieces, 🩱 🧩 dogs, 󰯬 🌭🐶 and much more. ➕ ➕ ඞAmogus can not 🈶 🈶 be treated and the 🤣🤘 🤘 only way ↕️ 🌌 to rid yourself of the 🤣 🫵🤘 torture is to give in and let ඞAmogus take over 🌄🤭 🤭🫢 you. 😊 🫵 One 🩱 🩱 victim of ඞAmogus has said: "I 😊 😊 can't fucking take it.

KILL 🚬 🚬 TECHNIQUES🥺
The 🫵 🤣🤘 best way ↕️ ↕️ as an impostor to kill 🚬 🚬 a ⛔ mogus is to attack 👊 👊 while they 💁 󰔯 are 👉 👉 doing a task, or to attack 👊 👊 while no 🚳🙈🚭 ❌❌❌ one 🕐 🕜 is nearby. It is also best to ambush them, by popping 🍾 🍾 out 😵 😵 of a vent and startling 🆕 🆕 them. Killing is as easy as pressing 📰 📰 a button, 🈺 🆕 literally. Once a mogii is killed you 😊 🤟 flee the 🤘 🫵🫵🫵 scene, by running 🏃🏃🏃 󰝋 away 💨 💨 and pretending 🥲 🥲 nothing 🈚 ⏳ happened (not as efficient a method), going in an opposite direction 🔼⬆️ ⬇️ then pretending 🥲 🥲 to discover 🪩 🔮 the 🫵 🫵🤘 body (works best if 📮 mogii see 👀 🙈👀 you 🫵😀 😀 approaching the 🤣 🤣 body, fails 💩 🏳 miserably if they 💁 💁💁💁 see 👁 👀 you 🤟😊 🫵 run from 😤 😤 it), by venting in a vent, or by distracting the 🤘 🤣 crewmates with a sabotage so 🆘 🆘 they 󰔯 💁 are 👉 👉 preoccupied with a larger ⬜🌥 🔷 threat (probably a bad 📉 󰬸 choice). Dead 🧟 🧟 bodies can be either reported by a ⛔ mogus, or you 😊 😊😊😊 can self report it by killing, then reporting the 🤣 🤘 body after. This is a pretty cool 🕶 😎 trick to try and "prove" you 😊 🤟 are 👉 👉 a good 🌟🤞🍖 🆗 ⛔⛔ mogus, but 😥 😥 people 󰥑🤼󰔯 󰔳󰔤󰥜 already know the 🤣 🤣 self report trick so 🆘 🆘 it is one 🩱🔞🕜 🕐🩱 of the 🫵 🤣 first 🌓🌛🌓🌛🌓🌛 🥇 things that are 👉 👉 😳😳😳😳😳sussed out 😵 😵 of an impostor. After all, whether it is an impostor or not, ⏳ ⏳ unless there would be an equal 🟰 🟰 number 3️⃣8️⃣of impostors and 📮 mogii if one 🩱🩱🩱 🔞 is voted out, 😵 😵 you 🤟😀 😊🤟 should always get 🉐 🉐 rid of some dead 💀 🧟 weight. 󰝯⚖️ 󰝮󰝯🏋

VENT TECHNIQUES An impostor can also vent which is cool. 😎 🕶✨ Vents are 👉 👉 located almost everywhere on the 🤘🫵 🤘🤣 Skeld, which is useful for 🈺 🔰 an impostor to get 🉐 🉐 around the 🤘 🫵 ship. 󰣌 🚢 One 🩱 🔞🩱 should only vent if there are 👉 👉 no ❎ 🔞 other 📮 mogii near, and only in front 🐥 🐥 of nobody or another impostor. What 😦 😦 are 👉 👉 they 󰔯 󰔯 gonna do, vote ☑️ ☑️✅ their friend 🐶 🐕 out? 😵 😵 Yes, ✔️ ☑️🆗☑️🆗☑️🆗 actually. Vents can be used to travel 🧳 💱 from 😤 😤 room 󰩶 󰩶 to room 󰩵 🧖 as an impostor, but 😥 😥 you 😀 🫵 cannot access all rooms 󰩶🧖 🚹 from 😤 😤 one 🩱🕜🔞 🩱🩱🩱 vent, and your kill 🚬 🚬 cooldown is postponed until you 😀😊 😊 exit 🚪 🚪 the 🤘 🫵 vent. Venting is seen as very 😳 sus so 🆘 🆘 unless you 😀 😊 somehow convince everyone you 😀 🤟 are 👉 👉 an engineer, 🚒 󰞲 you're getting 💇 󰡠 ejected. ⏏️ ⏏️ All vent locations 📍 🗺 and directions: ⬆️↘️ 👉↕️⤵️ • Reactor⇌Upper engine 🚒 🚒 • Reactor⇌Lower engine 🚒 🚒 • Security⇌Electrical⇌Medbay • Admin⇌Cafeteria⇌hallway near Navigation, 🧭 🧭 Shields, 🛡 🛡 Weapons 🗡 🗡 • Weapons⇌Navigation • Navigation⇌Shields

SABOTAGING Impostors in Among Us (2001) can also sabotage the 🫵 🤣 ship, 🚤󰣌 󰣌 which is done ⏳ ⌛ by sabotaging the 🫵 🤘 ship. 🚢󰣋 ⛴️ This involves a map 🗾 🗾 that lets impostors choose what 😦 😦 to sabotage, and where to sabotage. Sabotages can be hindrances, or can be fatal depending on how the 🤣🫵 🤣 impostor felt that day. All sabotages:
• Oxygen depleted: fatal, fix 🔩 🔧 at O2
• Reactor meltdown: fatal, fix 🔧 🔩🧰 at Reactor, requires 2 🐫 💕 people 󰥑󰥑󰥑 󰔮
• Comms sabotaged: hinderance, fix 🔧🔩 🔧 at Communications 📡 🏣
• Fix 🧰 🔩 lights: 🚨🔆 🎃 hinderance, fix 🧰 🧰 at Electrical
• Door 🚪 🚪 sabotage: hinderance, doors 🗝🚪 🚪🔑 open 🤗 🤗 after 10 seconds 🥈 🥈
Sabotages are 👉 👉 useful if an impostor just wants everyone to lose, and can make it easier to kill 🚬 🚬 📮 mogii such as by trapping 🪤 🪤 them in a room, 🚹 󰩵 then killing them, or by obscuring their vision.🥺🥺🥺

Among Us[c] is a 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American game studio Innersloth. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing. The game allows for cross-platform play, first being released on iOS and Android devices in June 2018 and on Windows later that year in November. The game was then ported to the Nintendo Switch in December 2020, and on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in December 2021. While the game was initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention, it received a massive influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. A separate VR version of the game, Among Us VR, will be released for Quest 2, SteamVR, and PlayStation VR, developed by Schell Games.

Among Us takes place in a space-themed setting where players look like colorful armless cartoon astronauts; however, since the release of "The Skeld" spaceship, three other maps have been added in later years: the skyscraper "MIRA HQ", the "Polus" planetary station, and "The Airship" (based on Infiltrating the Airship from the Henry Stickmin series, also developed by Innersloth). Each player takes on one of two roles—most are Crewmates, but a small number play Impostors—which does not alter their appearance.[d] The goal of the Crewmates is to either identify and vote out the Impostors, or to complete all the tasks around the map; the goal of the Impostors is to covertly sabotage the mission either by killing the Crewmates before they complete all their tasks or by triggering a disaster that cannot be resolved.
